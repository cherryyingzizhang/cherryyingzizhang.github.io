The reason why I have so many internships, despite being an undergraduate student, is because my university has a continuous co-op system where I take alternating 4 months of co-op and 4 months of school until I graduate. Therefore, I will have lots of internships and experience. I am looking forward to pursuing graduate studies in the future in the following fields: robotics, artificial intelligence (particularly affective computing and machine learning), and psychology.</p>

      <li>Research – researched in academic literature and wrote a literature review, elaborating upon the rehabilitation of various reading disabilities</li>
      <li>Design – Learned VBA in 1 day, reviewed/debugged an already made prototype of the application in VBA, and decided on which parts to improve/port over to the Android app, and which parts to scrap</li>
      <li>Software Documentation – wrote product requirements, functional specifications, and design specifications</li>
      <li>Development – developed the application on Android with the Eclipse IDE (ported it to Android Studio afterwards)</li>
      <li>Debugging – debugged the application with steps/breaks and logging</li>
      <li>Testing – tested the application side-by-side with an actual user who has a reading disability, among

      <h3><a name="html-parser" class="anchor" href="#html-parser"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2013 - HTML Parser</h3>

      <p>An Android application. You can choose an html file (.txt) from the phone's internal storage and then it will parse the HTML and display it on the screen. I did not use any HTML parsing libraries and implemented the entire parsing algorithm myself, by first writing pseudo code, and then typing up the real code/debugging later. The algorithm is not based off of any known parsing algorithms so in a sense, it is very "brute-forced" (wrote it before I took any algorithms course).</p>

      <li>Simple Shooting Video Game (though used a tutorial on kilobolt.com)</li>
      <li>Simple Drawing App - When I first began to Play around with Android, mobile development, Touch Gestures, and Canvas class</li>
      <li>MultipleImagePickWithPicasso - Library I made based on the actual open source one called MultipleImagePick. Android only had "single image pick" from the user's files, so the only way you could do a "multiple image file picker" was to implement one yourself. I improved upon the original MultipleImagePick by: removing the deprecated code it had, using the Picasso library for the image loader, and replacing the "picker window" as a fragment instead of an activity to make it more modular.</li>
      <li>keybase_mobile_client - private repo on Github where I experimented using Keybase.io's APIs to be able to encrypt and decrypt messages to people. Keybase.io uses public key cryptography method in order for users to easily encrypt and decrypt secret messages - it's cool!</li>

      <p>This is a web application for the Global Koding Hackathon 2014. It uses an API to get real-time information on all reported natural disasters around the world, and then we categorize them between earthquakes, floods, tornados/hurricanes, etc. and then we display them on an interactive map (which is another API). Then, people can use this service to donate to these natural disasters. This service's purpose is to make donating to charities more accessible and readible available, and you can earn "tokens of appreciation" (a.k.a. game-like points) for doing so. <a href="https://github.com/younghj/KodingHack">Click here for Github repo.</a></p>

      <p>This was an iOS application that connected to a backend machine learning service, and recommended recipes based on the user's background/other users' ratings. I personally did not do any iOS dev, but instead solely focused on the backend. It was a lot of work and I learned how to apply machine learning concepts I learned from the machine learning online Coursera course. Azure Machine Learning was what we initially attempted to use, as it made an automatic web service so we did not have to manually make our own API. the Azure recommender system uses a hybrid collaborative-filtering and content-based filtering system to recommend recipes. It was really hard to actually scrape the data, but to also clean the dataset , and then formatting the features well enough so we do not get inaccurate recommendations/false positives from insignificant features, et cetera. After we finally trained our machine learning model, there unfortunately was a documented bug at the time about the inability to deploy the model as a web service for the iOS client app to use. Then, we tried to use Django to make an API during the few hours we had left. It is suffice to say that we did not completely finish the backend, but I personally learned a lot on how to actually implement recommender systems. <a href="http://devpost.com/software/reciperecommender">Click here for links to the three Github repos.</a></p>
