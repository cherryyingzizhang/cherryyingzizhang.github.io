{"name":"Cherry Zhang","tagline":"Mechatronics Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo","body":"## Welcome to My Page\r\nI am a first year mechatronics student and love software. The engineering programs in my university have a co-op system where I take 4 months of co-op, 4 months of school, and this cycle repeats. I am currently on my second co-op term.\r\n\r\n## Main Projects\r\n### Lexica (from past internship)\r\nAn Android application that helps people with reading disorders\r\n### Imaggle Android Version (from past internship)\r\n\r\n## Side Projects\r\nImaggle Inc.'s Android version of their iOS application (which is like a mobile e-commerce app, kind of like Google, but for womens' clothes)\r\n### HTML Parser\r\nAn Android application. You can choose an html file from the phone's sd card and then it will actually parse the HTML and display it on the screen. I did not use any automatic HTML parsing libraries. I created the algorithm myself.\r\n### Hangman Game\r\nAn Android application that I made when I first started to learn Android.\r\n### Drawing Application\r\nAn Android application that is like the Microsoft Paint application.\r\n### Side Scroller Game\r\nI practiced developing and finishing a simple Java applet game and ported it onto Android. This game was made from a a tutorial on www.kilobolt.com\r\n\r\n## Previous Internships\r\n### Android Developer and Research Assistant at the University of Waterloo\r\nMy job was to research and develop an android application for people with reading disabilities. It was to be \r\nan improvement from an earlier prototypal concept written in VBA. I participated in every part of the \r\nsoftware’s lifecycle.\r\n* Research – researched on the rehabilitation of various reading disabilities and wrote a research paper\r\n* Design – Learned VBA in 1 day, reviewed/debugged a prototype of the application in VBA, and decided \r\non which parts to improve/port over to the Android app, and which parts to scrap\r\n* Software Documentation – product requirements, functional specifications, and design specifications\r\n* Development – developed the application on Android with the Eclipse IDE\r\n* Debugging – debugged the application with steps/breaks and logging\r\n* Testing – tested the application side-by-side with an actual user who has a reading disability, among \r\nother users (mostly by using LogCat and step/breaks)\r\n\r\n### Android Software Engineer at Imaggle Inc (in Tokyo, Japan)\r\nMy job was to make an Android version of the currently existing iOS Imaggle application. It is an app similar to eBay, but for mobile phones. The app also specifically is for the buying and selling of womens' clothing.\r\n* (was) main contributor and then sole developer of the Android version of Imaggle (after the other guy left)\r\n* used Parse as the backend (www.parse.com) and the Bolts framework to do serial and parallel asynchronous tasks\r\n* used Aviary SDK, Picasso SDK, and other technologies\r\n\r\n### Software Engineer at Microsoft (Japan)\r\nI will soon fill this page out. I will be starting this internship in mid-October of 2014!\r\n\r\n## Contact Me\r\nEmail: y689zhan@uwaterloo.ca\r\n\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/shad0wing\r\n\r\nStackOverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/users/3324013/cherry-uw","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
